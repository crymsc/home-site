    <div class="main">
        <br>- proofread basically anything
        <br>----- will only fix grammar and spelling, as well as formatting inconsistencies
        <br>----- max 5k words, but down to bargain
        <br>
        <br>- draw a silly mspaint doodle
        <br>----- since my art's style and quality are far from consistent, i dont do proper commissions
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>NOTE: whether or not i will take the job is, ultimately, my decision.
        <br>i'm usually nice, but i kinda have to say this as im literally just a guy (who has a life)
        <br>shoot me a message on discord and i'll respond within less than a day
